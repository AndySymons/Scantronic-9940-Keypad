# Project KELLY - Integrate Scantronic 994x Keypads into ESPHome and Home Assistant

The objective of this project is to be able to use the Scantronic 994x Keypads in an ESPHome and Home Assistant environment. One or more keypads could be used independently or in conjunction with my [Scantronic 9651 hardwired alarm interface - project HARVIE](https://github.com/AndySymons/HARVIE-Hardwired-Alarm-Replacement-Board). 

I have no specification or circuit schematic, so the first phase of the project is to reverse engineer the data communication protocol. 
The second phase will be to build the necessary hardware and software components for the ESPHome and Home Assistant environment. 
    
It is a part-time project, so could take a while; but watch this space, and please share any info you may have on this subject :-)  


## The Scantronic 9940 and 9941 Keypads


The unit measures 115 x 115 x 24 deep. The lower half is s flap that can be lowered to access the keypad.

Up to four can be conected to a Scantronic 9651 alarm controller with normal alarm cable. The maximum distance between any kepad and the controller is 200m. 

The keypad has several features that make it atractive as a stand-alone product. Alternatively, a result if this project will be that existing keypads can be retained in a system using the [HARVIE replacement board](https://github.com/AndySymons/HARVIE-Hardwired-Alarm-Replacement-Board).
